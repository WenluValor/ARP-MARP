Open the run.ipynb, click each chunk for the results.

Note: to reproduce real data (Section 8), the user needs to run the code chunk first, a folder named 'real-data' will be created and an error message will appear.
The user needs to follow the error message: 
1. Download the csv.gz from http://go.criteo.net/criteo-research-uplift-v2.1.csv.gz into the folder 'real-data'
2. Unzip the csv.gz and rename the csv file as 'criteo-uplift.csv'
3. Run the chunk again
